                </p>
                <br>
                <p> The main coursework I've completed at my time here at Texas A&M include: </p>
                <p> Data Structures, Linear Algebra, Discrete Math, Algorithm Analysis, Computer Architecture, Digital Forensics, Computer Organization, Cryptography, Software Engineering, Computer Systems </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My main areas of interest include cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and product design.
                </p>
                <p> Cybersecurity has interested me from a very young age. I grew up in Saudi Arabia, and vividly remember the Shamoon attack where a foreign entity took down the entire company complex where I lived. I didn't have internet for an entire summer and from that point I've always been intrigued at how much impact the cyberworld can have on our everyday lives. That trend has just accelerated, and if my internet were down for that long now I wouldn't be able to pay bills and buy necessities.</p>
                <p> Artificial intelligence has just recently started to become an area of interest for me. It seems that everything revolved around AI now and I want to understand why and how. Our world is heading in a direction where all aspects of our lives will be touched by AI. It's time to learn how to use it.</p>
                <p> I've always been a dreamer. I constantly have new ideas and a hunger to learn more. This interest really started from participating in focus groups in high school. I would help companies point out issues and give me thoughts on where their product should go. The inner workings of companies has always been interesting to me, and I've been able to stretch that muscle at both of my previous internships. At ScOp, I helped the VC manager look through slide decks and determine which companies were the best positioned investments. At Yogi, I worked on the product team and we constantly dicussed how to outperform our compeitors. In my eyes, developming products is the main way to do that and I want to continue pursuing roles that allow me to have a say in where the product goes.</p>
